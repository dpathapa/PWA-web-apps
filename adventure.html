                             <p>Sky diving can now be done in Pokhara or the Everest Region of Nepal. Skydiving in Nepal gives us the opportunity to feel to breeze as we wrestle though gravity and free fall with the glorious Himalayas as the backdrop. This aerial adventure takes you on a plane to Gorak Shep from where the free fall takes place, witnessing some of the magical views and sites of the Khumbu region.  Another option can be to skydive in Pokhara, with the mighty Annapurna surrounding you as you free fall from the skies.</p>

                                 <p>Paragliding involves the pilot sitting in a harness and controlling the flight according to the aerodynamics of the wind. Paragliding first started in Pokhara but now is opened in various areas like Bandipur, Simkot and Godawari. The best idea about paragliding is flying over the entire valley as if we were witnessing it through a fish eye lens. We offer tandem paragliding in various areas of the country.  Let us know if the idea of flying across the valley and coming to an eye level of the hills and mountains intrigue you.</p>
